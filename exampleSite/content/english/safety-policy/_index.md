**The safety of employees at work is a core value of Grit Technologies Limited. No other business objective has higher priority.**

This Safety Policy is to guide all employees of Grit Technologies Limited and its affiliates (together, “Grit Energy” or the “Company”) in pursuing their responsibility, shared with the Company, to safeguard the health and well being of everyone involved with Grit Technologies Limited.

Grit Technologies Limited recognizes that safety is beneficial to the employee, the family, the community, the customer and the Company. Grit Technologies Limited is therefore committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees and requires that safety should not be compromised for any other business priority. We expect companies providing services to Grit Technologies Limited to have the same high standards of safety and health as we do.
It is the responsibility of the Company to provide the facilities, equipment, tools, procedures, safety programs and training for employees to work injury free. It is the responsibility of each employee to work safely for the benefit of the individual as well as co-workers. This responsibility includes following appropriate safety rules and planning each work activity using appropriate risk assessment, good judgment and skills, along with a sincere dedication to work safely.

Employees should not start work until they understand what work is to be done and how to do it safely. They are all expected to be engaged in the Company’s Safety Management process. Engagement includes communicating with all the parties involved about safety-related behaviors and conditions, and bringing to management’s attention those issues which require their involvement and support.

All employees in leadership positions are responsible for deploying and actively supporting the Company’s overall Safety Program. Included in this responsibility are monitoring and enforcing the use of safe working practices and safety rules.

All of us, through our leadership, commitment and engagement must accept the challenge to work safely and actively to pursue injury and illness prevention. Our employees, business partners, community and customers will all benefit. Grit Technologies Limited encourages all employees to carry this strong health and safety value beyond the workplace to all of their activities.
